WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.
Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive
action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book,
winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on
ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will
talk about.
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—
sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful,
especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make
over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1
percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better
by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day
for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win
or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.
